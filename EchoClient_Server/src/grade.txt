Project 1:

Functionality: 40/50
Design/Style: 30/30
Documentation: 15/20

Comments: Your code works, but there are a couple of major issues. The biggest one is that when
I try to run it without any command-line arguments, it does not print a help message, but throws
an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. As such, it makes it pretty difficult to know exactly how
to run your code without reading it. Additionally, your code contains no comments or documentation,
which would be helpful for graders who read your code.

Penalties:
    Server crashes when no arguments are provided: -10
    No comments: -5

Grade: 85/100
